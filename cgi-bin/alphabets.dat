# This file defines one or more simplified amino acid alphabets.
# The format for such an alphabet is as follows:
#
# [name of alphabet]          # the name of the alphabet enclosed in square brackets
# ADKLH G       (name)        # simplification rule: amino acids A, D, K, L, H are combined into G
# YTRS  K       (name)        #                                  Y, T, R, S                      K
# ...
#
# - a '#' introduces a comment. It may be placed anywhere in a line and
#   everything which follows a '#' is completely ignored
#
# - The groups of amino acids and the combined letter may be seperated by one or more
#   spaces or TABs
#
# - The name of a group may be seperated from the combined letter by again one or
#   more spaces or TABs
#
# Okay, let's begin with the simplifying ;-)
